Auto Install IoT Demo with OpenShift
=========================================
This project adds IoT demo setup to the OpenShift install demo. 

If you are looking to develop containerized applications, the OpenShift Container Plaform (OCP) can help you by providing 
private PaaS (Cloud) environment you can install locally. It includes the same container development and run-time 
tools used to create and deploy containers for large data centers. 

This project requires a docker engine, OpenShift command line tools and VirtualBox, but these checks happen when you run the
installation and point you to what is missing. It also checks that you have the right versions running too.

Pro Tip: Pay close attention to conosle output, will guide you to dependencies you need if missing. These dependencies are 
listed here and the install provides pointers to downloads if missing:

   ```
   1. VirtualBox for Windows and OSX
   2. Docker engine version 17.03
   3. OpenShift Client (oc) v3.5.5.5
   ```


Install on your machine
-----------------------
1. [Download and unzip.](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/ocp-install-demo/archive/master.zip)

2. Run 'init.sh' or 'init.bat' file, then sit back. (Note: 'init.bat' must be run with Administrative privileges.)

3. Follow displayed instructions to log in to your brand new OpenShift Container Platform!


Notes
-----
Log in to the OCP console with:
   
   ```
   Developer user:  openshift-dev
   Developer pass:  devel

   Admin user: admin
   Admin pass: admin
   ```

If you recieve the following error, on Linux:

   ```
   Error: did not detect an --insecure-registry argument on the Docker daemon
   ```

Then ensure that the Docker daemon is running with the following argument by:

   ```
   # Add the following to /etc/sysconfig/docker file and
   # restart the docker service:
   #
   INSECURE_REGISTRY='--insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16'
   ```

This project has an install script that is setup to allow you to re-run it without worrying about previous
installations. If you re-run it, it removes old 'openshift' machines and reinstalls for you.
